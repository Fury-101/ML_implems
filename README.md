# Machine Learning Implementations

Custom machine learning implementations of various ML architectures for knowledge using only basic libraries.

Currently includes
- Simple Linear Regression
- Fully Connected Neural Network
- Convolutional Neural Network (dynamic layers and activation function support)

Models may be CPU-heavy
